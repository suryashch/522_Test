This is a test environment for the class DSCI 522. There is an environment.yml file for dependencies and a Creative Commons License.

Here is the code you might need when committing to the github -->
- git branch <name>
- git switch <name>
- This is where I want my merge conflict to occur

Remember to push to the new branch once committed -->
- git push origin <branch>.
- git branch -d <name> will delete the branch locally.
